This Chrome extension allows users to subscribe to repositories for push and pull request notifications.
Note: Intially this was a complete extension but later on this push notification service has been migrated from the extension to the web due to new Chrome Manifest V3 restrictions that do not support non-Google authentication logins.

## Features

- Subscribe to repositories to receive notifications for push and pull requests.
- Integrated with GitHub API for real-time updates.
- Built with Vite React, Node.js with Express, and TypeScript.
